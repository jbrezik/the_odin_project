    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) chicken thighs</li>
        <li>2 cups dill pickle juice</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Â¾ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag; cover with pickle juice. Seal and refrigerate for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Drain pickle juice from thighs. Cover chicken; refrigerate until ready to fry.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour buttermilk and flour into 2 separate bowls. Season flour with salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in buttermilk. Toss in flour. Return to buttermilk and toss in flour a second time. Place chicken on a rack set over a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Fill Dutch oven with as many thighs as possible without crowding. Cook at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Place thighs on the baking sheet. Repeat until all pieces are fried. Transfer thighs to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with a pinch of salt.</li>
    </ol>
